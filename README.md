## My Happy Cat

Make my own "Cat Care" game. Use conditionals such as `if`, `else`, and `elif` statements to lay out the logic and the story's path in this program. Players will be presented with various choices to make regarding their cat's well-being, and they must type their chosen option from the available choices.

# Instructions
<!-- Run the Program: -->
Run the program by executing the main Python file:
python cat_care_game.py
<!-- Gameplay -->
*You will be presented with various scenarios and choices regarding your virtual cat's care.*
*Read the scenario carefully and type your chosen option exactly as it appears in the prompt.*
*Follow the instructions to take care of your virtual cat and see how well you can keep them happy and healthy!*

# Extensions
I created this game based on the project Day 3 in 100 Days of Code course.
